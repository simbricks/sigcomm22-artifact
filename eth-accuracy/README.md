# Ethernet channel accuracy

This experiment will validate statements in `7.5`.  

The total experiment will take a few seconds to run to complete.

In this experiment we show that SimBricks Ethernet channel doesnâ€™t break simulation accuracy. We run two simulated hosts purely (no SimBricks host simulators) in ns-3. The two hosts are connected over an Ethernet link. One host sends 20 packets in `1 us` period and the other host receives. The channel delay is set to `500 ns`.

We now run this simulation in two separate configurations. First, with everything in a single ns-3 instance without any SimBricks components, and the hosts connected together using  a`SimpleChannel`. Second, we run the two hosts in separate ns-3 instances and connect the hosts together using SimBricks Ethernet adapters (configured with identical link latency to the previous configuration). 

The hosts in this experiment will log the sending/receiving event logs including timestamp. We then compare simulation traces for the hosts in both configurations. For the SimBricks experiment, it will generate two log files under `simbricks/experiments/out/accuracy/`, one from sender (`sender.time`), the other on from receiver (`receiver.time`).   You will find sender sends one packet per `us`, and the receiver receives exactly `500 ns` later.

For the ns-3 standalone experiment, one sender & receiver aggregated log file `(single_ns3.time)` will be generated. You will find it the sending and receiving exactly matches with SimBricks runs.
